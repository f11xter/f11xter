**Hey there!**

Iâ€™m a 19-year-old programmer in my first year studying Computer Science at The University of Manchester.

Iâ€™m also a 19-year-old cellist studying with [Simon Turner](https://simonturnercello.wordpress.com/).

Iâ€™m mainly interested in software development but am always eager to get stuck into other areas.

### Current projects:
- [Discord bot](https://github.com/whimsicalities/mcsoc-bot/tree/dev) for the the University of Manchester Minecraft Society
- My [website](https://f11xter.github.io/) ([source](https://github.com/f11xter/f11xter.github.io))
- CivBuilder - an idle game built with Unity

### Languages:
Dart, Flutter, Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

### About my logo:
My logo fuses my two main hobbies, music and coding, together. The concept was to combine the C:\\> prompt found in cmd.exe with the bass clef that I read music in as a cellist (it took me many years to notice this looks like a reversed C).
